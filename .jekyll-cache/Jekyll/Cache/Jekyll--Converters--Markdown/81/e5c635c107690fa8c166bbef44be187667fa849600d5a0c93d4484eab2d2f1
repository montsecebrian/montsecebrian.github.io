I"Ê<p>Blood. Then less blood. Multiple bone pieces become one again.</p>

<p>Arms and legs untwist themselves on the ground</p>

<p>reclaiming their regular human form.</p>

<p>Skull fragments fusion together. The still-dead head regaining shape,</p>

<p>like an inflating balloon.</p>

<p>Blood finds its righteous course through the body, now alive,</p>

<p>levitating upwards, unconscious.</p>

<p>Like in one of those alien abduction movies we used to like.</p>

<p>The cell phone puts itself together as well, some pieces crawling in the dust,</p>

<p>from afar.</p>

<p>The crack in the screen vanishes. The last picture appears.</p>

<p>Our last picture.</p>

<p>The phone goes in search of the body, both up in the air</p>

<p>amongst the dark oranges of the deep canyon cliffs and the blue of the sky.</p>

<p>Boy and phone reunite like destiny on a Greek tragedy,</p>

<p>He opens his eyes. He panics.</p>

<p>A wail emerges from his mouth, his legs and arms moving frantically.</p>

<p>Flying up, but not flying.</p>

<p>Foot barely on the ground now. Then less barely.</p>

<p>Wail turns into a smile.</p>

<p>I feel your left hand on my waist.</p>

<p>The boyâ€™s right hand holds the phone. He tries to frame the two faces,</p>

<p>and the perfect landscape on that perfect day.</p>

<p>He turns back, dragging her along.</p>

<p>Now facing that perfect landscape again on that perfect day.</p>

<p>The dark oranges of the deep canyon cliffs and the blue of the sky.</p>
