I"Ÿ<p>You are going to be rejected. Get used to it.</p>

<p>Your best friend will pick you last for the team,</p>

<p>and youâ€™ll hide under the bleachers to soothe your soul with intense reading</p>

<p>but youâ€™ll never win a literacy award, either.</p>

<p>Your crush wonâ€™t ever reply to that message that took all your strength</p>

<p>to write and send,</p>

<p>and your unrequited first love will make out</p>

<p>with your nemesis</p>

<p>at your birthday party.</p>

<p>Youâ€™ll get many emails and letters</p>

<p>that will regret to inform you that youâ€™ll have to</p>

<p>come up with a new dream.</p>

<p>You wonâ€™t get the job, you wonâ€™t get the apartment, you wonâ€™t get the promotion,</p>

<p>you wonâ€™t find which medicine works best for your depression.</p>

<p>Your metro card will refuse to swipe</p>

<p>and youâ€™ll miss the train on your way</p>

<p>to the doctor that will confirm that your embryo</p>

<p>refused to stay in your uterus.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s this scientist on TV talking about the universe.</p>

<p>He says there are hundreds of billions of galaxies out there.</p>

<p>Each galaxy may have hundreds of billions of planets.</p>

<p>We, imperfect humans, are a grain of sand on a massive beach.</p>

<p>What are you? You are the smallest particle within that grain of sand.</p>

<p>You wonâ€™t get any â€œlikeâ€ or any comment on your latest post,</p>

<p>and your soulmate will forget your birthday,</p>

<p>and youâ€™ll want to quit everything forever.</p>

<p>Oh but think how small all your rejections are as well!</p>

<p>How little they matter in the immensity of the universe!</p>

<p>You are going to be rejected, and youâ€™ll get over it.</p>
