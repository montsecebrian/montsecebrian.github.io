I"f<p>I am alone in a big waiting room. There are no windows, and one of the white fluorescent lights on the ceiling is blinking. I have been there for hours, waiting for someone to call and interview me. I suddenly realize I don’t have my bag; I must have left it on the subway. I get out of the waiting room and go downstairs to the lobby. There are two chairs and a bench next to the front desk. Two ladies I know from high school are sitting on the chairs, talking animatedly. I sit on the bench and ask them if they have seen my bag. They stop both talking and smiling. One of them grabs something from the floor and gives it to me. It is my bag. I check nothing is missing and wonder if I should go back upstairs. A large man in a suit approaches me and tells me that the car that will take me to my interview is ready and waiting for me. I follow the man out of the building and to a red car. It takes me a few minutes to get inside, as the interior is quite narrow. Once inside, I notice it is completely round, like a bumper car, and the driver does drive it as if it was a bumper car. He takes me outside the city and to a large warehouse. When the car finally stops, a small young lady with wide glasses and a notepad welcomes me by name and takes me inside, to an open waiting area. It is some kind of studio lot where they are shooting a questions-and-answers TV show. The lady with wide glasses calls a handsome guy who is sitting on a sofa near me and tells me that I am the next one after him. The guy starts hosting the TV show like a natural. I suddenly realize I don’t have my bag; I must have left it in the car.</p>
