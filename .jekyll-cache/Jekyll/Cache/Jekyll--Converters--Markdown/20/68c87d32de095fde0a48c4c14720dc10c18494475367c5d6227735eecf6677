I";<p>You are the princess in white, like a Greek sculpture
carved in marble.</p>

<p>I know you hated that someone covered your ears</p>

<p>with two cinnamon buns.</p>

<p>You are the princess who doesnâ€™t need saving,</p>

<p>like a cat that purrs one second and attacks the next.</p>

<p>You are the princess dressed as a belly dancer</p>

<p>in a metal bikini.</p>

<p>I know you also hated that,</p>

<p>except when you wrestled your way out of slavery.</p>

<p>Die! slimy giant slug! Die!</p>

<p>Smelly tongue hanging out of his mouth.</p>

<p>You still were a princess after our popcorn boxes were empty.</p>

<p>You were a princess with your head between your arms,</p>

<p>a glass of vodka in one hand, prescription pills in the other.</p>

<p>Lines deepening in your skin as you kept fighting beasts</p>

<p>that were not on the screen.</p>

<p>But you still did it,</p>

<p>like a cat that purrs one second and attacks the next,</p>

<p>strangling the giant slugs of life while laughing like a banshee.</p>

<p>A princess banshee with two cinnamon buns over her ears.</p>
