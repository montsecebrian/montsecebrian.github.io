I"¸<p>There was a pizza in the oven and custard in the fridge. That didnâ€™t happen often, and could only mean one very exciting thing. My sister and I were meticulously supervising the progress of the melting cheese when my parents announced they were leaving. Mom and dad were going to a holiday party, dapper, jolly, and perfumed. My sister and I attuned our ears waiting for the magical sound of the apartment door closing behind them. Then the elevator. Then a few more seconds just to be extra sure they hadnâ€™t forgotten anythingâ€¦ Finally! We looked at each other and smiled: we were alone for the night!</p>

<p>Our grand plans included pizza, custard, and a movie. My sister was in charge of the oven, of course, being five years older. I was allowed to help with the custard, but the remote was my sisterâ€™s domain as well. We didnâ€™t have a VHS player back then, so we were at the mercy of network programming. She didnâ€™t hesitate in her choosing, though. She said she had already watched that movie, but that it was pretty cool. I was amazed by all the wonderful things my sister had done, seen, and learned during the years before I was born, or during the time I was too little to remember we actually did things together. We both snuggled under the blanket and ate our custard.</p>

<p>The movie hypnotized me. I was confused at the beginning, but my sister told me it was ok, as there was a first part I hadnâ€™t seen yet. I kept watching, and then there were spaceships, and magic, and treason, and friendships, and robots! Oh! Mom and dad would have never picked that movie! I felt exhilarated. I kept asking questions, and my sister smiled and said â€œYouâ€™ll see.â€ During some scenes, she actually looked at me with an amused look, waiting for my reaction. â€œVader is Lukeâ€™s father!?â€œ I was actually scared during that one, and she hugged me. My eyes were stuck on the screen, and my heart and stomach were going up and down. â€œLuke and Leia are brother and sister!? And Leia has powers, too!â€ I yelled. My sister didnâ€™t say anything, she just nodded very slowly as her big-sis smile widened from ear to ear. â€œBut why is the movie ending his way?!â€ I was about to cry. My sister promised me there was another one, and she had to swear over her new stereo that Han was alive so that I stopped begging for information. She gave me some custard she had saved â€œfor laterâ€ and we both went to bed, we dreamed, and we grew up.</p>

<p>Someone asked me recently what was my favorite movie. I replied without hesitating: â€œThe Empire Strikes Back.â€ â€œAh, you like fantasy movies, then?â€ They said, and I replied that yes, that I do like fantasy and science fiction, and I said to myself that I also like homemade pizza, and custard, and snuggling under a blanket, and hugs.</p>
