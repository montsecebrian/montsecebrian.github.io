<p>â€œAnd are you willing to give up all of this?â€ Asked the time traveler for the millionth time that week as they left the theater, their brains still inebriated with music, and costumes, and laughter, and tears, and drama. The time traveler opened his arms and turned around, as if trying to encompass the entirety of Times Square, with its unashamed glitter and loud bustle.</p>

<p>â€œYa, vamos! Itâ€™s cold and I want to get to Harlem rÃ¡pido,â€ replied Lorca with his thick Spanish accent. He had already stopped a cab and was holding a door open, signaling effusively to his friend so that he entered the car. Once they both were inside and the checker cab blasted, then roared, then moved, Lorca, with his wide smile and bright eyes, gazed at the time traveler, one hand over the otherâ€™s leg.</p>

<p>The time traveler wasnâ€™t used to the bumpy rides of the 30s, he was also not used to breaking rules, yet there he was.</p>

<p>â€œFederico, pleaseâ€¦â€ the time traveler kept trying, relentlessly. â€œI want to enjoy our last weeks juntos, si?â€ Lorca said, actively ignoring the time travelerâ€™s words. â€œYou wanted to see Duke Ellington, tocar el piano!â€ Lorca said, while moving his arms theatrically as if he was playing an invisible instrument. Lorca even sang something unintelligible. The time traveler, inevitably, surrendered to Lorcaâ€™s genuine enthusiasm and naked charm, and so it was that the cab driver heard a burst of laughter coming from the back.</p>

<p>Turned out that Billie Holiday was accompanying Duke Ellingtonâ€™s orchestra that night. Lorca, with the same amused look as the very same day he first set foot in New York, asked: â€œIs she also remembered in your time?â€ â€œShe is,â€ replied the time traveler, and with renewed fervor, he continued: â€œyou know, talented musicians like her will turn your poems into songs, and everyone will remember them a hundred years from now.â€ The time traveler paused, briefly. â€œPlays! you will write plays, better than the one we saw tonight, and they will turn them into movies, and Hollywood stars will be in them!â€ And while Lorca was beaming, a dark cloud re-appeared over the time traveler. â€œPlease stay. You know what will happen. Donâ€™t go to Spain, Federico,â€ the time traveler persisted. â€œPeroâ€¦â€ Lorca continued: â€œyou see, I have to go home, a mi hogar, and write all those poems you say.â€ â€œThey will kill you, Federico, you will lose.â€ Lorcaâ€™s face was like a remnant of peace. He was smiling, a tear shyly forming in his eyes. â€œBut I have already won,â€ he held the time travelerâ€™s hands between his, that tear already sliding down. â€œPeople will remember me many years from now. I have already won.â€</p>
