Yes! You can be an excellent project manager while being an introvert, and in my very humble opinion, the fact that we are even asking this question comes from a poor understanding of what an introvert is, fostered by many misleading pop-culture portrayals of introvert characters, plus an overlying culture where introversion doesnâ€™t scream success.

So this is how this post will go. First, I will review some famous pop-culture introverts that foster this (wrong) idea of introverts being shy, weird, anti-social, or socially awkward. Then, I will share what it means to be an introvert. Finally, Iâ€™ll get into why introverts make for great project managers. 

Something important to keep in mind is that introversion/extroversion is not an either/or situation. There are many shades in the spectrum between one and the other, and everyone is a beautiful, distinct individual falling somewhere in the myriad of possibilities of introvertness/extrovertness. Of course, some treats may apply to many of us in a general way, and that is what I will focus on, spicing it up with my personal experience as, yes, you got it right, I think I lean towards the introverted side of things ðŸ™‚.

# Introverts in pop culture

Letâ€™s start with **Clark Kent** ([Superman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman)). Clark's introverted nature stems from his desire to lead a quiet, unassuming life. He dons those glasses, slouches his posture, and works as a mild-mannered reporter to avoid the spotlight and keep his extraordinary abilities under wraps. It's all about blending into the background and going unnoticed in his everyday interactions. Of course, he does this so that no one suspects he is Superman, the hero, the genuinely successful guy soaring through the sky, wearing a colorful suit, and performing heroic acts for all to see.

Another hero: **Peter Parker** ([Spiderman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man)). He's like the introvert poster child among superheroes. In school, he's this socially awkward loner, but when he puts on that Spidey suit, he's swinging from buildings and taking down bad guys like a boss.

Heroes aside, we have **Sheldon** from [The Big Bang Theory](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0898266/), who takes nerdiness and social awkwardness to the extreme. I know, I knowâ€¦ the show requires this kind of distorted behavior because it is a sitcom, and it is supposed to be fun, but still. The harm is already done.

Let's remember [Sherlock Holmes](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b018ttws). The guy's a genius, no doubt, but he's also a bit of a sociopath who couldn't empathize his way out of a paper bag. It's like he's too busy solving mysteries to bother with feelings.

I have more. What about **Temperance Brennan** from [Bones](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460627/)? She finds solace in solitude and prefers delving into forensic analysis and scientific research over social interactions. So yeah, she's a total brainiac in the lab, but when it comes to office politics and bureaucracy, she's a bit lost, projecting a biased image of lacking leadership skills.

Then thereâ€™s this extremely **annoying idea that the introvert needs to be fixed**. Enter **Laney** from [Sheâ€™s All That](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0160862/). She is the textbook introvert hiding behind her oversized glasses, absorbed by her paintings, and utterly clueless about what matters until the popular/successful extrovert around swoops her to provide a makeover that saves her from a horrible life as an introvert.

So yeah, introverts are often portrayed in the media as stereotypes that donâ€™t fit and must be fixed to succeed. It's not just annoying. It's kind of sending the message that quiet folks, the nerds or the geeky ones, aren't good enough just as they are. Oh wait, yes, introverts are often acceptable, but that only happens when introversion comes with exceptional intelligence. Kill me now.

Well, okay, to be honest, I am being a bit dramatic. There are many introverts in pop culture portrayed way more kindly than the examples above. For example, **Mr. Darcy** from [Pride and Prejudice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_and_Prejudice) is a charming introvert we can agree we all love and cherish. Here you have a [video that goes through some of those introverts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdzSlESEzXo) in a quite sympathetic way while also debunking some introversion misconceptions.

# What it really means to be an introvert

We introverts are not necessarily antisocial or shy. We usually like people, and we are not afraid to interact with others. We can even be quite talkative, but we get emotionally drained after spending too much time with people, especially big crowds. When we recharge, we deeply enjoy our time alone with our solitary hobbies.

I feel some people may think I am an extrovert because interacting with others in a friendly way (at work or outside of it) comes easily to me, it really does, but here is the deal: I couldnâ€™t do it if I werenâ€™t able to rest in the evening, spend some time crocheting, watching TV, reading or even playing quiet video games.

If I have an office party, I need to recharge in advance. I will enjoy it, but only if my social batteries are recharged. I remember when we used to do [PI planning](https://scaledagileframework.com/pi-planning/), and it was customary to go out and party after the last day of planning. It killed me. I generally liked my co-workers, but after a long week of calls, negotiations, prioritization, and planning, the only socializing I could afford was a glass of wine in a quiet place with just a couple of them. 

It is not easy for me to make friends, so I donâ€™t have many, but the ones I have are family. I love spending time with them, but quietly. A perfect day? Possibly a day with just one of them, maybe two, wandering around, talking, maybe stopping for coffee or food, walking around again, then going home early because we both need a bit of solitude.

I need time to process things. I like to introspect and think thoroughly before expressing my ideas. I donâ€™t have problems communicating and do well in collaborative environments, but I need to prepare in advance. To my co-workers who write comprehensive agendas, share the pre-reads in advance, and are clear on the goal and what they expect from everyone in the meeting: thank you. I love you. 

Okay, here you have a couple of pages if you are interested in what it means to be an introvert.

# Why introverts make excellent project managers

Sometimes, I feel that extroverts tend to steal the spotlight in the fast-paced world of project management, especially technical project management. It is not their fault; they are lovely, but we have already seen that quietness and the need to introspect are often confused for social awkwardness and the inability to communicate, which are big NOs in project management. Luckily, we know it is not true. Also, introverts can unleash their inner power and prove themselves fantastic project managers.

**Introverts are great listeners**. The ability to pay close attention comes out of the box. They'll hear you out, and they'll hear the guy in the back of the room, too. This is essential when we need to gather inputs or gain insights.

**Introverts are also big on self-reflection**. They like to think things through and learn from their mistakes. This self-awareness makes them open to feedback and better at adapting their management style. They're not afraid to switch things up when needed, which can save a project from going off the rails.

**Introverts thrive in calm and organized environments**, which is like a dream come true for productivity. They'll set up a space where the team can actually focus on their work without constant distractions. 

**Introverts are good with conflict**. Not creating it, LOL. Introverts are masters at resolving it. They approach disagreements with a level head, trying to understand the root issues and find win-win solutions. In a world where project hiccups and clashes are inevitable, having an introverted manager who can keep the peace is a blessing.

**Introverts are all about risk management**. They're the type to think before they leap, meticulously assessing potential pitfalls and planning for the worst. This cautious approach helps them spot problems early on and take measures to avoid project disasters.

So, there it is. Don't underestimate the power of introverts in project management. We are here to stay and slay!
