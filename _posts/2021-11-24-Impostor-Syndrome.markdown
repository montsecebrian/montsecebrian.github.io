1.

Work harder.

And when the office turns

silent, its old souls at home

wrapped in warm lights and

familial embrace,

find something new

to learn. Remain in the

usual darkness

only broken by raw

blue light. This is me.

But who can blame me

for wanting to be a better

and deserving

human being?

2.

Deep within me, I never thought

I could, so when I did, it felt

unreal, incomplete.

Underserved privilege.

Unexpected luck.

Every single accomplishment,

a fake

hidden in plain sight.

Work harder

so that no one notices.

3.

Do you remember the story of

the ugly duckling?

Oh, but imagine If

the ugly duckling never matured

to become a beautiful swan

and remained an ugly duckling forever.

4.

I envy those living placidly.

Do they ever feel the swarm?

But this is me.

So work harder.

Look inside.

The fact that I can always

work harder

Is the only real thing

In my life.
