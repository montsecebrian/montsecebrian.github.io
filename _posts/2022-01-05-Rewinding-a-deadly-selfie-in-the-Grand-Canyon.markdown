Blood. Then less blood. Multiple bone pieces become one again.

Arms and legs untwist themselves on the ground

reclaiming their regular human form.

Skull fragments fusion together. The still-dead head regaining shape,

like an inflating balloon.

Blood finds its righteous course through the body, now alive,

levitating upwards, unconscious.

Like in one of those alien abduction movies we used to like.

The cell phone puts itself together as well, some pieces crawling in the dust,

from afar.

The crack in the screen vanishes. The last picture appears.

Our last picture.

The phone goes in search of the body, both up in the air

amongst the dark oranges of the deep canyon cliffs and the blue of the sky.

Boy and phone reunite like destiny on a Greek tragedy,

He opens his eyes. He panics.

A wail emerges from his mouth, his legs and arms moving frantically.

Flying up, but not flying.

Foot barely on the ground now. Then less barely.

Wail turns into a smile.

I feel your left hand on my waist.

The boyâ€™s right hand holds the phone. He tries to frame the two faces,

and the perfect landscape on that perfect day.

He turns back, dragging her along.

Now facing that perfect landscape again on that perfect day.

The dark oranges of the deep canyon cliffs and the blue of the sky.
