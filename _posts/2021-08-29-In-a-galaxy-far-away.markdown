You are the princess in white, like a Greek sculpture
carved in marble.

I know you hated that someone covered your ears

with two cinnamon buns.

You are the princess who doesnâ€™t need saving,

like a cat that purrs one second and attacks the next.

You are the princess dressed as a belly dancer

in a metal bikini.

I know you also hated that,

except when you wrestled your way out of slavery.

Die! slimy giant slug! Die!

Smelly tongue hanging out of his mouth.

You still were a princess after our popcorn boxes were empty.

You were a princess with your head between your arms,

a glass of vodka in one hand, prescription pills in the other.

Lines deepening in your skin as you kept fighting beasts

that were not on the screen.

But you still did it,

like a cat that purrs one second and attacks the next,

strangling the giant slugs of life while laughing like a banshee.

A princess banshee with two cinnamon buns over her ears.
